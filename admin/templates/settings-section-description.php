		It allows folks to casually interact with others,
		wherever they are, whenever they feel like it. It's all about genuine conversation, not &ldquo;meetings&rdquo; with &ldquo;teams&rdquo;.
		This service is completely free of charge for basic use, though you will get some sweet extras if you upgrade to a
		<a href="https://spontan.io/premium" target="_blank">premium account</a>.
		No login or download is required &ndash; everything runs inside your browser. And we do not display ads or sell your data to anyone.</a>
